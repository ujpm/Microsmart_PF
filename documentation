📅 Milestone 1: The "Eye" (Vision Model Training)

Status: ✅ Completed
Date: November 2025
Environment: Google Colab (Tesla T4 GPU)

1.1 Model Architecture

utilized YOLOv8 Nano (v8n) for edge-optimized inference speed. The goal was to balance detection accuracy with the ability to run on low-cost hardware (e.g., standard lab computers or Vultr cloud instances).

1.2 Dataset Strategy

To address "Catastrophic Forgetting," utilized the Broad Institute DiagMal dataset via Roboflow. This allowed the model to learn multiple classes simultaneously rather than overfitting on a single parasite stage.

Source: Broad Institute / Roboflow Universe

Preprocessing: Auto-orient, 640x640 resize.

Classes: 8 distinct classes including healthy cells and specific parasite stages.

1.3 Training Results (50 Epochs)

The model demonstrated exceptional performance on the validation set, particularly for the target vector (P. falciparum).
